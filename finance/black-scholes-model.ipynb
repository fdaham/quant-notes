    "# Deriving the Black-Scholes Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Black-Scholes Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used to calculate the theoretical value of a stock option given its strike price, the stock's current price, time to expiration, expected dividends, expected interest rates, and expected volatility. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model is mainly based on the assumption that the market consists of at least one risky asset (stock) and one risk-free asset (cash). It assumes the following properties for those two assets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The risky asset’s price follows a geometric Brownian motion (i.e. behaves like a random walk with constant drift and volatility).\n",
    "* You can buy or sell any amount of the risky asset.\n",
    "* The risky asset pays no dividend.\n",
    "* The rate of return on the risk-free asset is constant (i.e. behaves like a regular interest rate).\n",
    "* You can borrow or lend any amount of the risk-free asset at the same rate as the interest rate.\n",
    "* There's no arbitrage (i.e. no risk-free profit opportunities).\n",
    "* There are no transaction costs (i.e. no commission for buying or selling securities or derivative instruments).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the assumptions listed above hold true in the real world, which limits the efficacy of the model. Some of those limitations (all of which should be hedged in any investment strategy) include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, which yields tail risk.\n",
    "* Assuming continuous and costless trading, which yields liquidity risk.\n",
    "* Assuming the stock doesn't pay dividends, which yields valuation risk.\n",
    "* Assuming risk-free interest rate and volatility remain constant, which yields volatility risk. \n",
    "* Assuming no early exercise of the option, which makes it difficult to apply to American options as they can be exercised at any time before maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Black-Scholes Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to deriving the Black-Scholes formula is finding the Black-Scholes equation, which is a second-order linear partial differential equation used to calculate the price of a European stock option as a function of time. It's defined as: "
