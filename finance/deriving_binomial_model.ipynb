    "# Deriving the Binomial Option Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial Option Pricing model is a risk-neutral method for pricing path-dependent options. This makes it popular for valuing American options since they can be exercised at any time before their expiration dates. The model iteratively calculates the value of an option by assessing the probability of its underlying asset's price increasing or decreasing at each step within a period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the Binomial Option Pricing model represents a binomial distribution of future stock prices. The binomial tree below shows an example of an American call option's expected payoff over time, where $c$ is the current call option price; $c_u$ and $c_d$ are the expected option prices once the stock value increases or decreases by a factor of $u$ or $d$, respectively; and so on.\n",

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial Option Pricing model assumes the following of its underlying asset (stock) and the market as a whole:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The price of the underlying asset will either increase or decrease at each step (i.e. there's no third option for the price remaining constant--hence *binomial*).\n",
    "* The underlying asset pays no dividends.\n",
    "* There's no arbitrage (i.e. no risk-free profit opportunities that can change the value of the asset). This is especially needed for the Binomial Option Pricing model to work\n",
    "* The market is frictionless (i.e. no transaction costs).\n",
    "* The risk-free interest rate is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are limitations to the Binomial Option Pricing model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It doesn't scale well; its computational complexity is directly proportional to the number of periods in the model. \n",
    "* It heavily relies on predictions of future stock prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta Hedging\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we calculate the value of the option at each step? Let's start by focusing on a single iteration of the binomial tree shown above, where the price of the stock $S$ either moves up, $S_u$, or down, $S_d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "S_u = S(1-u) \\\\\n",
    "S_d = S(1-d)\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:1} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u$ is the percent by which $S$ increases and $d$ is the percent by which $S$ decreases. The volatility of the stock is used to estimate $u$ and $d$. The payoff of the American call option $c$ held on the stock with a strike price $K$ is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "c_u = max(S_u - K, 0) \\\\\n",
    "c_d = max(S_d - K, 0)\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:2} \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "These can also be denoted as $c_+$ or $c_-$, but I'm going to stick with $c_u$ and $c_d$ here. Now, let's assume a risk-free interest rate $r$ follows $d < r < u$ for a portfolio that consists of a single American call option $c$ with $h$ shares of stock. The value of the portfolio when the price of the asset increases or decreases is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\Pi_u = hS_u - c_u \\\\\n",
    "\\Pi_d = hS_d - c_d\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:3} \\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can optimize $h$ such that the value of the portfolio is the same regardless of whether $S$ goes up or down by equating both $\\Pi_u$ and $\\Pi_d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "h = \\frac{c_u - c_d}{S_u - S_d} = \\frac{max(S_u - K, 0) - max(S_d - K, 0)}{S_u - S_d}\n",
    "\\label{eq:4} \\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows us that $h$ doesn't depend on the probability of $S$ increasing or decreasing, but only $S$, $K$, $u$, and $d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as listed above, we're assuming that the risk-free portfolio $\\Pi$ grows at the risk-free interest rate $r$. So, after one period (12 months) of growing at the risk-free rate, the value of the portfolio becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Pi = (1+r)(hS - c)\n",
    "\\label{eq:5} \\tag{5}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this is equal to $\\Pi_u$ = $\\Pi_d$, we can start solving for $c$ (starting with $\\Pi_u$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "(1+r)(hS - c) = hS_u - c_u \\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow c &= hS - \\frac{hS_u - c_u}{1+r} \\\\\n",
    "&= hS(1 - \\frac{1+u}{1+r}) + \\frac{c_u}{1+r} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:6} \\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the definition of $h$ in Equation $\\eqref{eq:4}$ gives:\n",
    "\n",

    "c &= \\frac{\\frac{c_u - c_d}{s_u - s_d} S(r-u) + c_u}{1+r} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{\\frac{(c_u - c_d)(r-u)}{u-d} + c_u}{1+r} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{c_u \\frac{r-d}{u-d} + c_d \\frac{u-r}{u-d}}{1+r}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\label{eq:7} \\tag{7}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set $p = \\frac{r-d}{u-d}$, where $p$ is the risk-neutral psuedo probability of $S$ going up in one period. It makes sense that this probability is based on the size of the up-move as well as the risk-free interest rate. Also, since the probability of $S$ going up or down is mutually exclusive, the probability that $S$ goes down in one period is $1-p = \\frac{u-r}{u-d}$. Equation $\\eqref{eq:7}$ then becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "c = \\frac{pc_u + (1-p)c_d}{1+r}\n",
    "\\label{eq:8} \\tag{8}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using $t$ as the time step, or period multiplier (e.g. $t = 0.5$ is a 6 month period), gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\boxed{c = \\frac{pc_u + (1-p)c_d}{(1+r)^t}}\n",
    "\\label{eq:9} \\tag{9}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for an American put option $p$ and probability $q$ (renaming probability $p$ above to avoid naming collisions), we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\boxed{p = \\frac{qp_u + (1-q)p_d}{(1+r)^t}}\n",
    "\\label{eq:10} \\tag{10}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the current value of an option is a factor of its probability-weighted future payoffs.\n",
