    "### The 2-Egg Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the minimum number of drops needed to find the lowest floor that an egg will break on when dropped from a 100-story building given 2 eggs?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be the lowest floor from which the egg will break and $n$ be the maximum number of drops required to find $x$. Our procedure for finding $x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Drop the first egg on floor $n$.\n",
    "* If the egg breaks on floor $n$, go to the ($n-1$)th floor and drop the second egg. \n",
    "* If the egg doesn't break on floor $n$, then go up $n-1$ floors and drop the second egg.\n",
    "* Repeat this process until we hit floor 100. There are $n-1$ drops remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting the total number of drops we have from this 100-story building, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "&n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\cdots + 1 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 100 \\\\\n",
    "&\\Rightarrow n^2 + n - 200 = 0 \\\\\n",
    "&\\Rightarrow n \\approx 14\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the minimum number of drops required to find $x$ is 14. Specifically, we should start on floor $\\frac{13(13+1)}{2} = 91$.\n",

    "### The K-Egg Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "*([LeetCode #887](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/)) Same as above, but with $n$ floors and $k$ eggs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this problem is a sequence of $t$ successful/failed drops, where the maximum number of failed drops is $k$ (since we only have $k$ eggs to break). The total number of sequences of length $t$ with $k$ failed drops (i.e. the maximum number of floors we can drop the eggs from) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(t,k) = \\sum_{0 \\leq i \\leq k} {t \\choose i}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of repeatedly summing ${t \\choose i}$, we can multiply the previous iteration by $\\frac{t-i}{i+1}$ since:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "{n \\choose k} \\frac{n-k}{k+1} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\frac{n-k}{k+1} = \\frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k-1)!} = {n \\choose k+1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, solving for $f(t,k)$ is only half of the problem. The next half requires us to find the least $t$ such that $f(t,k) \\leq n$. Since $f(t,k)$ is an increasing function with respect to $t$, we can find $t$ using binary search."
