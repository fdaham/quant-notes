    "# Stochastic Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process is the change of a random variable over time. Stochastic calculus is the counterpart of this process in continuous space. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the present value is used to predict future values. This process is best represented using Markov chains. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gambler's ruin problem: Player 1 starts off with $\\$1$ and Player 2 starts off with $\\$2$. The winner of each game wins $\\$1$. Player 1 is the favorite and wins $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the time. They continue playing until one player loses all of their money. What's the probability of Player 1 winning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of winning at each stage is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "p_0 &= 0, p_3 = 1 \\\\\n",
    "p_1 &= \\frac{1}{3}p_0 + \\frac{2}{3}p_2 = \\frac{2}{3}p_2 \\\\\n",
    "p_2 &= \\frac{1}{3}p_1 + \\frac{2}{3}p_3 = \\frac{1}{3}p_1 + \\frac{2}{3}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this system of equations gives $p_1 = \\frac{4}{7}$ and $p_2 = \\frac{6}{7}$. Player 1 starts at $\\$ 1$, so the probability that they win is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Martingale Process\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time $t$, the expected value of the final value is the current value. A martingale stopped at a stopping time is a martingale. All Martingale's are Markovian, but not the other way around. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "A process $S_n$ is a random walk if $S_n = X_1 + \\cdots + X_n$ and each random variable {$X_i ; 1 \\leq i \\leq n $} is identical and independently distributed. Think of $S_n$ as your position at time $n$ after making $X_1, \\cdots, X_n$ successive random steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetric Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can only move backward or forward (i.e. $X_i = -1$ or $X_i = 1$) with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$, respectively, then $S_n$ is a **simple random walk**. In addition, if $p = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $S_n$ is considered to be a **symmetric random walk**. Symmetric random walks are martingales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The drunken man problem: A drunk man is on a 100-ft long bridge. He's currently 23-ft in and has an equal probability of stumbling forwards or backwards. What's the probability that the drunk man makes it to the other end of the bridge (the 100-ft point)? The end where he started (the 0-ft point)? How many steps is he expected to take to reach either end?\n",
    "\n",
    "The drunk man starts at 23-ft with $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. We can make this a symmetric random walk by setting his starting position to 0 and assuming he'll end up at either $\\alpha = -23$ (where he started) or $\\beta = 77$ (the end of the bridge). For a symmetric random walk, we know that $S_N$ and $S_N^2 - N$ are martingales, where $N$ is the total number of steps. That means his expected position at any time in the future is equal to his current position, which starts at zero. Therefore, \n",

    "\\begin{split}\n",

    "## Brownian Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous stochastic process $B(t)$ ~ $N(0, t)$ is a Brownian motion, also known as a Wiener process $W(t)$, if: \n",

    "* Continuous everywhere, but differentiable nowhere.\n",
    "* $B(t) - B(s)$ ~ $N(0, t-s)$, meaning its increments are independent and normally distributed.\n",

    "A Brownian motion is a martingale. This is the martingale property:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[W(t+s) | W(t)] = W(t)$ where $0 < s < t$.\n",

    "Let $B_t$ be a Brownian motion. What's the probability of $B_1 > 0$ and $B_2 < 0$? What if we know that $B_1 > 0$, what's the probability of $B_2 < 0$?\n",
    "\n",
    "If $B_t$ is a Brownian motion, then $B_1$ and $B_2 - B_1$ both follow $N(0, 1)$, which means they both have a half chance of being negative or positive. If $B_1 > 0$, then for $B_2 < 0$ we must have $B_2 - B_1 < -B_1$. Therefore,\n",

    "## Ito's Lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Ito's Lemma is the stochastic counterpart of the chain rule. It's used to find the derivative (a stochastic differential equation, or SDE) of a time-dependent function of a stochastic process. If $X(t)$ is an Ito process where $dX(t) = \\beta(t, X)dt + \\gamma(t, X)dW(t)$ and $f(X(t), t)$ is a twice-differentiable function of $X(t)$ and $t$, then:\n",

Random variable $X$ has a drift rate of $\\beta$ and a variance of $\\gamma^2$. For Brownian motion, $\\beta = 0$ (because $B_t$ is a martingale) and $\\gamma = 1$. \n",

    "1. If $B_t$ is a Brownian motion and $Z_t = \\sqrt{t}B_t$, what's the mean and variance of $Z_t$? Is it a martingale? \n",
    "\n",
    "    We know that $B_t$ ~ $N(0, t)$ and is symmetric about 0. $\\sqrt{t}$ is a constant at time $t$, so $Z_t = \\sqrt{t}B_t$ must also be symmetric about 0 with a mean of 0 and variance of $t(var(B_t)) = t^2$. Second, in order for $Z_t$ to a be a martingale, it must have a drift rate of zero. We can check for this by applying Ito's lemma to $Z_t$:\n",
